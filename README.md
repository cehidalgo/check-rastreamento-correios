# What is?

An terminal utility to check the package status at the brazilian public package service, Correios.

# How to use it?

Just run `node runtime <valid-correios-id>` or `npm start <valid-correios-id>`.

# Improvements to be done!

-  Add tests.
-  Use typescript.
-  Give a better validation treatment to this correios id passed to the utility.
-  Get improvements on the scrapping technique I just used.
-  Get the runtime in a proper executable (which I don't know how to do right now).
